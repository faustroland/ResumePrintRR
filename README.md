# ResumePrintRR
Companion script for RecRoom chip that allows resume interupted printing on McRen's printer

When you append this circuits board between the List Create Data and the Shirt Printer it allows you to continue with the print at specified line.
You need to enter some information where in the List Create Data the desired line is, which is calculated by python script (link in the description).
Note: Originally I tried to calculate the position inside the RecRoom, but it was almost as slow as the printing it from beginning. :-D

There is also the other script which is image_data.txt splitter. It comes handy, when your image_data has more than 4096 lines. (Requires "transparent" color in the room - simply add invisible collision with tag "X") - make your own or support me by buying the Resume Print invention which also contains the "transparent" color.
